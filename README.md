### My Portfolio Website
***

While I had done some coursework in programming at school, my first major project when I decided to seriously work towards entering front-end development was to create a website.  The purpose of the website was to display my skills in web design, but also to show that I could do a modern web project independently.  After researching trends in web development, I found that I should be striving to create a responsive website with images that display projects I have worked on.

My big challenge was that while I understood HTML and CSS from school and organizing material with `<div>` tags, I knew very little about modern frameworks like Bootstrap or the grid system that responsive sites used.  I ended up settling on the [960 Grid System](https://github.com/nathansmith/960-grid-system/) to use, however realized that it wasn't a responsive framework and by the time I realized there was a responsive equivalent, [Unsemantic](https://github.com/nathansmith/unsemantic), I had written most of the site in 960.  So I edited the code with media queries to make it responsive.

The result is a simple, responsive website that can be used on a variety of devices and displays previous projects I have done while being clean and aesthetically pleasing.  However, my skills have grown since I first wrote the site and in the future will give the site an update to keep in more in line with modern design trends, make it a bit more accessible, and update the projects I have done to further show my abilities as a developer
